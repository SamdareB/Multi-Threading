//Thread and Example in C++
//In every Application has a default thread which is main(). inside main thread we can creat a new threads.
//Thread is also known as light weight process,a single process may have many threads.
//Examples: in a browser we can open man tab and each tab represents a thread.
//In a MS world is also example of multiple threads that is for "formating the text" and "spell check".
//The below code represents how to creat a thread and access the thread in C++.
#include <iostream>
#include<thread>
#include<chrono>
#include<algorithm>
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;
ll countEvens = 0;//store the Count of the even numbers.
ll countOdds = 0;
//Function to find the even numbers between the given range including end.
void findEvenNums(ll start, ll end){

	for(ll i = start;i<=end;i++){
		if(i%2==0){
			countEvens++;
		}
	}
}
//Function to find odd numbers between the given range.
void findOddNums(ll start, ll end){
	for(int i = 0;i<=end;i++){
		if(i%2==1){
			countOdds++;
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	
	ll start = 1, end = 1000;
	//creat a thread t1 and it takes funcion name and parameters.
    std::thread t1(findEvenNums, start, end);
	//creat a thread t2 and it takes funcion name and parameters.
	std::thread t2(findOddNums, start, end);
	//the join() call that helps to run two thread parelally with main() thread.
	//join t1 to main() thread.
	t1.join();
	//Join t2 to main() thread.
	t2.join();
	cout<<countEvens<<" "<<countOdds;
	return 0;
}
